# Unity-fps-practice

This is just a practice project to make FPS.
This is not enjoyable game nor commercial product nor clone of something.

# main goal of this project

The goal is simple: **Make my own FPS game that satisfies me**
Although this is just practice project, I want to implement as much features as I can.
(actually it'll good practice for me)
But this is too simple and abstract. So I decided few objects to do:

- 1. Player can move with ASWD(or arrow keys etc)
- 2. Some parkour system(see [Parkour System](#Parkour System))
- 3. Gun shooting system(see [Shooting System](#Shooting System))
- 4. No online mode (for now)
- 5. Instead some maps and target boards

Those are just objects, so might not be added.


## Parkour System

I'll try to implement those actions.

| action | description |
|:-:|:-:|
| crouch     | crouch so that u can go through smaller space |
| wall jump  | Kick the wall, u get heigher |
| sliding    | crouching while running      |
| over       | get over some obstacles      |
| Climb up   | Climb up from edge. not something like spiderman does |
| rappelling | Rappelling from somewhere. Would this make game funny? |
| Bhop       | Bhop to run faster... like krunker.io  |


## Shooting System

Multi gun support might not be implemented.

| action | description |
|:-:|:-:|
| fire   | fire gun.  |
| reload | reload gun |
| ADS    | ADS.       |
| swap   | swap between primary and secondary |
